## About

This project aims to create an online room and equipment booking application. It will be targeted for use within CDU,
and will aim to replace the current, non-ideal solution.


## Developing

1. Make sure you have php and composer installed. More information on dependencies can be found in the [cakephp docs][1].

2. Install project dependencies and run the post-install script with composer.

   ```bash
   composer install
   composer run-script post-install-cmd
   ```

3. Copy `config/app.default.php` to `config/app.php` and edit as required. Note that `config/app.php` is the live config
   and not checked into git.

4. Install frontend dependencies with [bower](https://bower.io/#install-bower).

   ```bash
   bower install
   ```

5. Start the development server for testing while developing.

   ```bash
   bin/cake server -p 8765
   ```

   Then visit `http://localhost:8765`.

6. Run any tests with:

   ```bash
   composer run-script check
   ```
