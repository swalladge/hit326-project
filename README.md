# Room and Equipment Booking Web Application

Copyright Â© 2017 Mrinalini Padmanabhan, Jarrod O'Callaghan, Samuel Walladge


## About

This project aims to create an online room and equipment booking application. It will be targeted for use within CDU,
and will aim to replace the current, non-ideal solution.


## TODO


## Developing

1. Make sure you have php and composer installed. More information on dependencies can be found in the [cakephp docs][1].

2. Install project dependencies and run the post-install script with composer.

   ```bash
   composer install
   composer run-script post-install-cmd
   ```

3. Copy `config/app.default.php` to `config/app.php` and edit as required. Note that `config/app.php` is the live config
   and not checked into git.

4. Install frontend dependencies with [bower](https://bower.io/#install-bower). (Note: unless you are modifying what frontend js libraries are installed, this is unnecessary: all bower component files are stored in the repo.)

   ```bash
   bower install
   ```

5. Start the development server for testing while developing.

   ```bash
   bin/cake server -p 8765
   ```

   Then visit `http://localhost:8765`.

6. Run any tests with:

   ```bash
   composer run-script check
   ```

## Database

WIP - sqlite database being used for testing atm - some instructions:

```
# note: run from the project directory
# initiate the database (warning: drops tables before creating)
sqlite3 db.sqlite3 < db/init-sqlite3.sql

# load some test data
sqlite3 db.sqlite3 < db/test/example-data.sql
```
